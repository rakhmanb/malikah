Our Story
</h2>
<h1>
<small>
The story of Malikah began in 2013, this was the year I made the decision to start wearing hijab as a way to bring myself closer to Allath(SWT) and to strengthen my deen. It was a hard challenge at first, as I had an enormous love for fashion ever since I was a child. 
Moreover, there was no proper clothing in the market for a career hijabi woman such as myself. 
Most women would have undershirts and wear them under their normal office clothes; tops and even dresses that really just dont fit as business attire. The issue was not just contained within the office, just about going out any where I
would also be wearing undershirts under everything that I wore because all of the clothes were either short sleeved, transparent or too tight.

I was an investment analyst in Jakarta at the time and my job was not limited to staying at my desk, I was a representative of the company I worked with. I had to go to meetings with our partners, 
attend events that were organized by Indonesia's Stock Exchange, travel to issuer companies to collect data, sometimes having to go out of town to visit the issuers projects, meeting with other analysts, attending general meetings with stock and bond holders,
as well as the occasional meeting with the Director. That is why I needed to look professional and elegant at all times while still following the obligations of my faith.

I told myself that there had to be another way, an easier way for modest women to dress and yet still look classy and elegant at the same time, covering their physical beauty but letting their inner beauty shine. 
I started to make some pieces of modest wear for my self. 
And I was getting a lot of compliments from family, relatives, friends, coworkers, and some complete strangers. This is what encouraged me to start making and selling these dresses.

Having my own business in fashion has always been a dream of mine. The idea was around long before living in the US. 
I got a chance to take a dressmaking and fashion designing course at Monalita – one of the leading course providers for dressmaking and fashion designing in Indonesia. 
I was doing this in the middle of my busy days as a career woman at the same time preparing everything for my visa/green card to be able to move to the US and live together with my husband.
I arrived in the US by the end of 2015. Since then I have been trying to adapt to such a different culture in almost every aspect.

<small>
Moving to the US I had to re-invent my self - rebuild my life - yes, rebuild my life. In Indonesia I felt i had already climbed the career ladder, almost achieving everything that i had dremed and strived for, like moving a mountain
it had felt like momentum was on my side. Once I had arrived in the US I had to start all over again. But I always believe everything has been written in Lauhul Mahfuz, Allah SWT has a much more beautiful plan for me.

Year of 2016 has been rough for me – it was my very first year here in the US, all by myself 
(without my family) – but alhamdulillah I have a new family (my husband’s family) here who have all been very kind and welcoming to me. 
It wasn't until the end of the year I received my hidayah, realizing that I should have been getting closer to Allah SWT to fix me, my heart, my mind, my soul, and my life. 
Alhamdulillah, I am so grateful for having amazing parents that I always can talk to. Every time I feel down with what is happening in my life, I always remember what my Ayah (Dad) told me, 
“Fix your relationship with Allah first, then Allah will fix everything else in your life.” – I keep this close to my heart, and have been trying to implement it ever since.

<small>
Long story short, like everybody else, my husband and I too have new years resolutions, for 2017 my husband and I committed to be istiqamah to make more of an effort to becoming better people and to be better servants of Allah SWT; together little by little fixing aspects of our lives that need to be fixed. You never know which way Allah SWT touches you with His hidayah. Since then we read a lot more about our religion, seeking for a better and deeper understanding. 
Until that moment when I read a lot more about Sayyidah Khadijah bint Khuwaylid RA, I was so inspired by her, more than ever, I adore her, more than ever. 
She was Rasulullah SAW’s most beloved wife, she was a good daughter, she was a good mother for her children, also she is a mother of ummah. And do not forget, over a thousand years ago, she was the first successful female CEO.

After a better understanding about muamalah and shariah laws of trading, I am more determined to make my ideas about building a business in the modest fashion industry happen, 
this might be one of the many ways Allah SWT has provided for me to do some da’wah – because I believe everyone have their own way of doing it. 
I asked to myself, what can I do to benefit the ummah? Who am I? I am just an ordinary woman seeking for Allah SWT’s rahmah. I am not good at Arabic, English is not my mother language. What should I do? 
But I really would like to make a contribution to my community, society, ummah. My parents keep encouraging me that a muslimah has a high status in Islam and has a big impression on muslims' lifes, that’s why she should follow the 
guidance in the Qur’an and Rasulullah SAW’s Sunnah, so that she can create the righteous society and be a good representative and exemplar of Islam. That is what I keep in my mind to encourage myself to not give 
up at adding at least a small amount of value to our muslimin society.

And mashaAllah, Allah SWT presented me an opportunity. QS. Ar-Ra’d (13): 11, “ … Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of people until they change what is in themselves. …”; and Rasulullah SAW has said that Allah SWT said in a hadith qudsi:
 “Take one step towards Me, I will take ten steps toward you. Walk towards Me, I will run towards you.”. For this very step Allah SWT has rewarded me and my husband with one more gift we were not even thinking about. 
Establishing Malikah has felt just right for us, with only a little bit of working capital that we have from our savings. I know that it is all His barakah for us alhamdulillah. 
I am still connected with fashion, my biggest interest, but now I am doing it in the right way, inshaAllah. 
</small>

<small>
At Malikah we want to implement Islam not only in the modest collection we create but also in the way we conduct our business. 
“So make remembrance of Me, and I will make remembrance of you. And show thanks to Me, and do not be ungrateful.” [QS. Al-Baqarah (2): 152]. And Rasulullah SAW said “Convey from me, even if it is one verse.”, 
narrated by Abdullah bin Amr (HR. Bukhari). InshaAllah we will not only be concentrated on clothing, but remembering our Creator and the meaning of this life and everything we do in this life as well. 
That is the main purpose we build this business. I do not do business to provide for myself, as in Islam it is 100% of my husband’s responsibility. It is a self-actualization, 
I want to look up to the life of Rasulullah SAW’s wives who used their talents to earn their own income for sadaqah. For me and my husband it is important to support good causes for our ummah. 
We committed that 50% of the profit will go for good causes, and the rest will be used to keep improving our quality and practices, and keeping the business stable and functional in addition to this da’wah project.
